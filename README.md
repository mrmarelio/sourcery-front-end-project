## Git Guidelines

New features should be developed in separate branches starting with the `feature/` prefix, for example: `feature/SFE21V-7-Main-layout`. The `SFE21V-7` part is an issue number from JIRA, if there's no issue for this feature, feature key can be omitted.

Bugs should be fixed in related feature branches if the branch is not merged yet or in separate branches named with `bugfix/` prefix.

Start commit messages with `JIRA issue number` + `Fix`, `Add`, `Remove`, `Change`, etc. instead of `Fixed`, `Added`, `Removed`, `Changed`.

Commit messages should describe what will be done with this commit. Some examples:

* SFE21V-7 Add lodash to devDependencies
* SFE21V-7 Fix memory-leak in worker tasks
* SFE21V-7 Remove lodash from devDependencies
* SFE21V-7 Add functionality for pausing worker tasks
* SFE21V-7 Change the layout of the dashboard page

You may specify multiple issue number if commit is relevant for them or if using subtasks:

* SFE21V-7, SFE21V-8 Change the layout of the dashboard page

This enables to easily locate branch or related commits directly from JIRA story or lookup story when looking at commit history.
